# raspberry-pi

A Ruby port of the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) coding-agent harness — the parts we use — on the socketry async stack.

- **LLM layer:** [ruby_llm](https://rubyllm.com/) (harness-driven tool loop, model registry, MCP client)
- **TUI layer:** [ratatui_ruby](https://www.ratatui-ruby.dev/) (inline viewport chat, native Rust rendering)
- **Concurrency:** the [async](https://github.com/socketry/async) gem — one fiber-scheduler reactor for TTY input, LLM SSE streaming, and subprocess execution

Project contract: `architecture/BRIEF.md` in the parent space. Notable deliberate deviation from upstream: trailing whitespace is normalized at the write boundaries (read stays verbatim).
