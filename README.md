# raspberry-pi

A Ruby port of the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) coding-agent harness — the parts we use — on the socketry async stack.

- **LLM layer:** [ruby_llm](https://rubyllm.com/) (harness-driven tool loop, model registry, MCP client)
- **TUI layer:** [ratatui_ruby](https://www.ratatui-ruby.dev/) (inline viewport chat, native Rust rendering)
- **Concurrency:** the [async](https://github.com/socketry/async) gem — one fiber-scheduler reactor for TTY input, LLM SSE streaming, and subprocess execution

## Development

```sh
bundle install            # runtime deps: async, ratatui_ruby (pinned 1.5.0)
bundle exec rake          # minitest suite (headless, no tty required)
timeout 90 bundle exec ruby bench/seam_bench.rb   # seam bench, prints JSON + SEAM_BENCH_OK/FAIL
```

The bench runs itself inside a fresh 80x24 pty, self-asserts (hard internal
deadline < 60 s), and gates on: mean fps while animating ≥ 58, synthetic-event
dispatch p95 ≤ 30 ms, every delivered == expected, and a clean timeout-kill
probe.

## Project contract

`architecture/BRIEF.md` in the parent space. Notable deliberate deviation from upstream: trailing whitespace is normalized at the write boundaries (read stays verbatim).
